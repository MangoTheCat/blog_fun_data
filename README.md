# Fun data: open data with a sense of humour



Jeremy Singer-Vine sends out a [newsletter](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural) every week where he highlights a number of interesting open datasets (you can explore all the datasets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0)). At Mango we are all for open data so we thought we would also share some of the open datasets we think are Fun (with a capital F). 

### religions of the UK

### cause of deaths in  the US?

### pet ownership (cat vs dog)
